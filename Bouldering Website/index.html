              <p>
                Bouldering is a form of rock climbing that is performed on small
                rock
                formations or artificial rock walls without the use of rope or
                harnesses.

                bouldering focuses on short but intensive routes called
                "problems,"
                typically keeping climbers within a safe distance from the
                ground
                while they navigate challenging sequences of moves.
